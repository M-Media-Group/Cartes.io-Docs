## Introduction

This guide will help you get started with Cartes.io. It will cover the basics of creating and managing maps, as well as how to use the API and iFrame embedding.

## Your first map

### Creating a map

To create a map, click on the button "Create map" in the top right corner of the app.

### Setting the map's title and description

After creating the map, you can set the title and description by clicking on the "Map settings" button towards the bottom right corner of the app.

Then, press the "Save" button at the bottom of the form to save your changes.

### Limiting who can view and edit the map

You can set the map to be `public`, `unlisted`, or `private`. Public maps can be viewed and edited by anyone. Unlisted maps can be viewed and edited by anyone with the link. Private maps can only be viewed and edited by you (associated to your user account, so you'd need to be logged in to view or edit your own private map).

Once you're done, be sure to press the "Save" button at the bottom of the form to save your changes.

### Adding markers

To add a marker to the map, right click on the map where you want to place the marker. A popup will appear with a form to fill out.

Then, choose or create a category for the marker.

Below that, you can optionally write a description for the marker.

Finally, press the "Add marker" button at the bottom of the form to save your changes and add the marker to the map.

### Seeing marker details

Click on a marker to open the popup with the marker's details.

### Deleting markers

To delete a marker, click on the marker to open the popup, then click on the "Delete" button at the bottom of the form.

### Deleting the map

To delete the map, click on the "Map settings" button towards the bottom right corner of the app, then click on the "Delete map" button at the bottom of the form.

## Advanced map settings and features

### Upload markers from a GPX file
If you have the permission to `create markers in bulk` (email us to request it), you can upload a GPX file to create a lot of markers on the map at once.
