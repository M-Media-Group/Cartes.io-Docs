# Demos and Examples

## Demo map on the live app

You can view the demo map on the live app by following this link:
https://app.cartes.io/maps/048eebe4-8dac-46e2-a947-50b6b8062fec

The map is open for all to view and edit, so feel free to play around with it.

## iFrame embedding example

An example of how to embed the demo map on your website using an iFrame can be found on the iFrame developer docs:
https://docs.cartes.io/developers/iframe/

## postMessage events JSFiddle example

See how the iFrame postMessage events work in this JSFiddle example:
https://jsfiddle.net/cLpvtbej/2/

You'll see the demo map embedded in the iFrame, and the postMessage events being logged to the console as events on the map happen.
